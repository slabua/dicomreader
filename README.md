## Introduction to the Project

- DicomReader is a simple Java DICOM files decipher and it has been developed
  as part of the [Volumetric Bias Correction][R00] paperwork.
- DicomReader handles headers as well as images contained in the Dicom files:
  - Data (headers and pixel-value images) are saved into ascii plain text files.
  - A pgm version of the image files is provided as an option for the user.
- The graphical user interface, based on Swing components, allows the user to
  choose the file names where headers and images will be saved to.  
  If a pgm image is also desired, its name is automatically generated from the
  ascii text imageâ€™s file name.
- DicomReader needs a Dicom dictionary in order for it to work, where it can
  read Dicom tags from and take the correct action for each of them,
  accordingly.
- If multi-sliced Dicom files are provided, results will be saved with the
  same file basename selected in the user interface and a sequence number will
  be appended at its end, keeping the original file name extension unchanged
  (if provided by the user).
